  "bio": "Jake grew up in Bristol (UK) and completed his MSci in Chemistry at Imperial College London. He earned his PhD at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Prof. Jonathan Nitschke, where he worked on the self-assembly of helical metallopolymers. Jake then joined Prof. Matthew Fuchter’s group at Imperial College London as a postdoctoral researcher, working on molecular photoswitches. In 2022, he moved to Würzburg, Germany as a Humboldt Fellow with Prof. Frank Würthner. Since 2023, he has led the Greenfield Group as a Liebig Fellow, focusing on photoswitchable imines and light-driven out-of-equilibrium chemistry. In 2024 he was made an Emil-Fischer Fellow at the Faculty. Beyond the science, Jake is passionate about mentoring researchers, collaborative teamwork, and enjoys drinking too much coffee...",
