  "bio": "Deepu completed his Integrated BS–MS dual degree in Chemistry (minor in Biology) at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Trivandrum (IISER TVM). His master’s work in the group of Prof. Mahesh Hariharan explored halogenation effects on supramolecular assemblies and rylene-diimide systems for singlet fission. He gained further research experience through multiple internships in physical organic chemistry and materials science, including studies on organic semiconductors and biodegradable conducting polymers. In 2024, he joined the Greenfield Group at the University of Würzburg, first as a research intern and then as a PhD student, where he is investigating light-induced non-equilibrium steady states in supramolecular systems.",
