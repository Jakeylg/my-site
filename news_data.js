    "excerpt": "Our sixth paper reports enhanced photoswitching in N-alkyl imines, comparable to azobenzene.",
    "body": "N-alkyl imines are widespread in dynamic-covalent chemistry, but their E/Z photochromism is often overlooked. We showcase a simple strategy that boosts their photoswitching to wavelengths and PSS distributions comparable to azobenzene, including condensed-phase photoisomerization and isomer-dependent fluorescence.",

    "excerpt": "Light-fueled cascade drives a coupled, non-photoresponsive transimination out of equilibrium.",
    "body": "Using a network of four interconverting imines, photoirradiation drives a transimination into a NESS, shifting amine composition. That shift perturbs a second, non-photoresponsive transimination, amplifying the overall departure from equilibrium and providing a blueprint for light-driven reaction cascades.",

    "body": "Based on Clara Li’s Bachelor’s thesis with contributions from Jiarong and Lasse, we show that IBPs can match or exceed AIP performance. Regiochemistry dictates λ_max, PSS, and Z-isomer half-life; two pyrazoles can be better than one.",

    "body": "Coupling E→Z photoisomerization to transimination drives a nonequilibrium steady state under continuous light. Energy is stored both in the Z-imine and the nonequilibrium constitution, consistent with a light-driven information ratchet.",
