    "excerpt": "Jiarong wins the 2025 CGCA prize in a multistage competition.",
    "body": "We are delighted to share that Jiarong has won the Chinese-German Chemical Association (CGCA) PhD Prize 2025. The competition involved several stages, including submission of a CV, publication list, and recommendation letters, as well as a recorded video presentation explaining the work of their PhD thesis. From these applications, three finalists were selected to present at the 37th CGCA meeting, held this year at FAU Berlin, where Jiarong was selected as the winner. Congratulations to Jiarong for this great achievement.",

    "excerpt": "Our sixth paper reports enhanced photoswitching in N-alkyl imines, comparable to azobenzene.",
    "body": "N-alkyl imines are widespread in dynamic-covalent chemistry, but their E/Z photochromism is often overlooked. We showcase a simple strategy that boosts their photoswitching to wavelengths and PSS distributions comparable to azobenzene, including condensed-phase photoisomerization and isomer-dependent fluorescence.",

    "excerpt": "Light-fueled cascade drives a coupled, non-photoresponsive transimination out of equilibrium.",
    "body": "Using a network of four interconverting imines, photoirradiation drives a transimination into a NESS, shifting amine composition. That shift perturbs a second, non-photoresponsive transimination, amplifying the overall departure from equilibrium and providing a blueprint for light-driven reaction cascades.",

    "body": "Based on Clara Li’s Bachelor’s thesis with contributions from Jiarong and Lasse, we show that IBPs can match or exceed AIP performance. Regiochemistry dictates λ_max, PSS, and Z-isomer half-life; two pyrazoles can be better than one.",

    "body": "Coupling E→Z photoisomerization to transimination drives a nonequilibrium steady state under continuous light. Energy is stored both in the Z-imine and the nonequilibrium constitution, consistent with a light-driven information ratchet.",
